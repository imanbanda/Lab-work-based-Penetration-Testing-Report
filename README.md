# Lab-work-based-Penetration-Testing-Report

This is a complete pentest report that was done using Metasploit. Pentest stands for penetration test, which is when you test a computer system's security by trying to break into it. 

The report includes all the scanning that was done to look for weaknesses in the system's security. Different tools in Metasploit were used to do thorough scanning and reconnaissance. 

Reconnaissance means gathering information about the target system before doing any hacking attempts. This helps find potential vulnerabilities to focus on.

The report provides detailed documentation of all the steps taken during the pentest using Metasploit. It covers both the reconnaissance work to map out the system, as well as the scanning tools used to probe for specific security holes and weaknesses. 

In basic terms, this report gives the full play-by-play of how Metasploit was used to simulate hacking attempts on the target system in order to uncover and demonstrate security flaws. All the findings are documented to show what vulnerabilities exist.
